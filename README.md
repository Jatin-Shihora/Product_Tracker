<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

|![ic_all_store](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75017563/137791368-c54f6158-1aec-4ebd-a0b4-8da733d7343e.png)|![Main_Activity](https://github.com/Jatin-Shihora/Product_Tracker/blob/main/App%20images/product_tab.jpg)|


As the name suggests the app is developed for the purpose of tracking the products of a shop or a godawn .The main structure of the app is like an iventory tracking system which enables the shop keeper to track his/her products on daily basis and which will help to procure the goods in an optimized manner and also in a clean manner . Usually the shop Keepers have tedency to write everthing in traditional pen-paper system which later becomes tedious for them to track or sometimes it may get slipped through their mind and in the end they loose the track and the chaos begins . So to prevent this chaos the app is being deveoped.

Of course,my app does not have everything and since your needs may be different or I may have missed some corner cases or features . So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who have inspired me for working towards this app :) !!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements ;).
